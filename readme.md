# Bikesharing Data Exploration
## by Florian Berger


## Dataset
Two datasets have been created for and used within this analysis. The dataset for the bike rental system in the San Francisco 
contains 2,407,259 observations and the dataset for the bikesharing system in Boston contains 2,522,537 observations. 
Each observation is the activity of a user who is accessing a rental bicycle at a specific station and returning it at 
the same or at another station of the bike sharing system. Due to the aproach in the cleaning phase of the project 
the structure of both datasets is identical. The files the two datasets have been created can be downloaded [here]

## Summary of Findings
In the exploration phase I found, that in the San Francisco bike sharing system the rental bikes were more frequently used for 
short duration activities than in the Boston dataset. In Boston customers and subscribers used the bikes in average significantly
longer than in San Francisco. Concerning the distribution of bicycle uses throughout the year the Boston system showed a comparatively 
large difference between months with a low number of bike uses to months with a high number of bike uses. The distribution of user 
types showed similar evaluation results for San Francisco and Boston in 2019. For both datasets the portion of subscriber uses (clients 
with short term) access is about four times as high as the number of customers (annual membership). Further findings were that
within the Boston system only half the number of bicycles have been used throughout the year compared to the San Francisco system.
However despite the smaller number of bicycles a slightly higher number of total bike uses has been realized in 2019. Accordingly
the Boston bike sharing system also shows a lager number of uses per bicycle and a higher mean level of bike capacity utilization
than the San Francisco system in 2019.



## Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation I will focus on the differences in usage durations as well as in the frequency of bicycle uses within the two 
systems for the single months throughout the year 2019. I will leave out the deductions from the exploration of user types.

Furthermore I am going to emphasize the deductions concerning the economically relevant aspects from comparing the data from the two
bike sharing systems. Especially the higher capacity utilization for the resources within the Boston bike sharing system will be
examined.
